esm_catalog_utils documentation
===============================

:std:doc:`intake-esm <intake-esm:index>` is a python package that eases
analysis of Earth System Model (ESM) output.
It provides functionality for searching, discovering, and data
access/loading.

catalog of the output being analyzed.
This package, :mod:`esm_catalog_utils`, provides tools/utilities to build
